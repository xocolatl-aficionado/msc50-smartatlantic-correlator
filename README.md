Since this project is ongoing, code isnt ready to be made public. But below you will find a demo of it working with streamlit + GCP assets + data. 

**Usage**

1. Choose a SmartAtlantic dataset from the dropdown.
2. Code pulls in the SmartAtlantic dataset, then finds the nearest MSC 50 coordinate dataset.
3. "Generate Plot" will draw the graph, with both datasets.

P.S. Supports two SmartAtlantic datasets at the moment. Can be extended to further datasets if needed.
